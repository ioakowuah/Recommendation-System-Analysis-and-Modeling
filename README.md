# Recommendation-System-Analysis-and-Modeling
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
In modern e-commerce platforms, customers interact with items through actions such as views, add-to-cart, and transactions. However, most users only interact with a fraction of available items, making it difficult for them to discover products they are likely to purchase.
Without an effective recommendation system, businesses risk:
â€¢	Low product discoverability
â€¢	Reduced user engagement
â€¢	Missed sales opportunities
This project addresses this challenge by building a personalized recommendation engine using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on implicit feedback data.
